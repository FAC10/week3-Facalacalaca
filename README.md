## User Stories

We are developing a web app for a movie enthusiast with the following requirements:
- I want to be able to search for a genre of film and receive a list of recommendations of that genre
- I want to see gifs of each film recommended
- I want to be able to see a trailer for each of the films recommended

**Goals**
- [ ] Comprehensive Testing
- [ ] Mobile First Design
- [ ] Embed movie trailer into site

**Stretch Goals**
- [ ] Use Module Design Pattern
- [ ] Option to listen to soundtrack of films
- [ ] Add dropdown menu to browse other things than genre
- [ ] Add 'inspire me' button which returns a random recommendation

## The Process

1. We sketched out the design of the site and decided exactly what we wanted it to do.
2. Together we worked on the architecture of the code.
